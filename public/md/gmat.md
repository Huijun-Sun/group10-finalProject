# What is GMAT?


Any student planning to pursue an MBA abroad (and more recently, certain management or finance, related fields) has to take the GMAT - Graduate Management Admission Test. All top business schools use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate management programs, including MBA, Master of Accountancy, and Master of Finance programs.

It is a standardized computer adaptive test which means the difficulty of your next question will depend on the answer of your current question.



## Example:

Suppose the first GMAT question is of moderate level. You answer it correctly; the next question will be a little difficult as compared to the previous one and so on. As soon as you get an answer wrong, the next question will be relatively simpler.



## Note:

If you answer a difficult question correctly, your score shoots up by a good margin and if a simple question is answered incorrectly, you lose out by an equal margin.



## How Long is the GMAT?

The GMAT is 3.5 hours long and may take nearly 4 hours to complete if you take the optional breaks (hint: take the optional breaks!).



## What is Tested on the GMAT?

The scores for the last two sections, Quant and Verbal, are combined into one score on a 200 (low) to 800 (high) scale. This is the score most people care about when taking the GMAT.

#### Section 1: The Essay

During the first section, the test will give you an argument to analyze (it will resemble Critical Reasoning arguments) and you will have 30 minutes to compose an essay response. This section is given its own score, on a scale from 0 (low) to 6 (high).

#### Section 2: Integrated Reasoning

Then, you’ll dive straight into the Integrated Reasoning section, which was added to the GMAT in 2012. These questions cover both math and verbal topics. Some questions will more closely resemble pure math or verbal questions while others will be a true mixture of these skills. IR questions tend to provide a decent amount of extraneous information (information that we don’t need to use in order to answer the question); this section is testing your ability to wade through a bunch of data and identify the relevant information.

This section also has its own score, on a scale from 1 (low) to 8 (high). At the end of this section, you’ll be able to take an 8-minute break.

#### Section 3: Quant

After the break, you’ll start the Quant section, during which you’ll answer 37 math questions (in 75 minutes), covering topics from algebra, geometry, statistics, and other areas. Quant questions come in two flavors, Problem Solving and Data Sufficiency; they test the same underlying skills but do so in different ways, so you’ll want to learn the strategies for dealing with each type.

This section is scored on a scale of 1 (low) to 51 (high) and also combined with the Verbal score to produce a combined score on the 200 to 800 scale. At the end of this section, you’ll be able to take another 8-minute break.

#### Section 4: Verbal

Finally, after your second break, you’ll tackle the Verbal section, during which you’ll answer 41 questions in 75 minutes. These questions focus on grammar, reasoning, and logic. Sentence Correction questions ask you to pick the sentence that is grammatically correct and has a clear, logical meaning. Critical Reasoning questions want you to assess the logical construction of an argument. Reading Comprehension begins with a passage to read, accompanied by a series of questions to answer.

This section is scored on a scale of 1 (low) to 51 (high) and also combined with the Quant score to produce a combined score on the 200 to 800 scale.



## Warning:

Don’t get an answer wrong intentionally so that the next question becomes easier.



## Why?

This is because you don’t get as many points for answering a simple question, as you may lose by wrongly answering the previous one. Hence, the loss is more than the gain.



## Myth:

You should solve the first few questions (the first 8-9 questions) taking as much time as required and get them right. This is not true. It depends on the level of questions. You should not blindly follow this logic and lose too much time so that you do not have enough time in the end to solve the remaining questions which may turn out to be easier. It's “suicide”.



## Must do:

You SHOULD attempt all the questions even though you might have to mark an answer without spending enough time on it because an incomplete paper can cost you a loss of significant points.
