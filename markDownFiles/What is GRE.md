The Graduate Record Examination, or GRE, is an important step in the graduate school or business school application process. The GRE is a multiple-choice, computer-based, standardized exam that is often required for admission to graduate programs and graduate business programs (MBA) globally.

The GRE is developed and administered by testmaker [ETS](https://www.ets.org/) to provide graduate and business schools with common measures for comparing applicants’ qualifications and preparedness for graduate-level academic work. Graduate school and business school admissions committees look at your GRE score, along with your academic record and supporting materials, to assess your readiness for the rigors of graduate academic study.

What’s the takeaway? A high score on the GRE will have a direct, positive impact on your graduate or business school application.



## WHAT IS ON THE GRE?

The GRE exam measures your command of basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis as well as college-level vocabulary. More importantly, it measures your ability to analyze and evaluate written material, think critically, and solve problems. 



## WHAT ARE THE GRE SECTIONS?

You will receive three scores on the GRE:

- Analytical Writing
- Verbal Reasoning
- Quantitative Reasoning

These scores are generated by the following sections:

- 1 Analytical Writing Assessment section
- 2 Verbal Reasoning sections

In addition, you will see one of the following sections:

- Unscored (may be either Verbal Reasoning or Quantitative Reasoning)

The Quantitative Reasoning and Verbal Reasoning sections are each scored on a scale of 130 to 170. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning is 151, and the mean score for Quantitative Reasoning is 153. The Analytical Writing Assessment is scored from 0 to 6 in half-point increments, and the mean score is 4.0.
