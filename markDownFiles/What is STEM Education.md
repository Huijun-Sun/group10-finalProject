# What is STEM Education?

![STEM-blog](C:\Users\huiju\Desktop\546data\STEM-blog.png)

STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. Rather than teach the four disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEM integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world applications.



## **The Four STEM Disciplines**

#### **Science** 

Science is the study of the natural world, including the laws of nature associated with physics, chemistry, and biology and the treatment or application of facts, principles, concepts, or conventions associated with these disciplines. Science is both a body of knowledge that has been accumulated over time and a process—scientific inquiry—that generates new knowledge. Knowledge from science informs the engineering design process.

#### **Technology**

Technology, while not a discipline in the strictest sense, comprises the entire system of people and organizations, knowledge, processes, and devices that go into creating and operating technological artifacts, as well as the artifacts themselves. Throughout history, humans have created technology to satisfy their wants and needs. Much of modern technology is a product of science and engineering, and technological tools are used in both fields.

#### **Engineering** 

Engineering is both a body of knowledge—about the design and creation of human-made products—and a process for solving problems. This process is design under constraint. One constraint in engineering design is the laws of nature, or science. Other constraints include time, money, available materials, ergonomics, environmental regulations, manufacturability, and reparability. Engineering utilizes concepts in science and mathematics as well as technological tools.

#### **Mathematics** 

Mathematics is the study of patterns and relationships among quantities, numbers, and space. Unlike in science, where empirical evidence is sought to warrant or overthrow claims, claims in mathematics are warranted through logical arguments based on foundational assumptions. The logical arguments themselves are part of mathematics along with the claims. As in science, knowledge in mathematics continues to grow, but unlike in science, knowledge in mathematics is not overturned, unless the foundational assumptions are transformed. Specific conceptual categories of K–12 mathematics include numbers and arithmetic, algebra, functions, geometry, and statistics and probability. Mathematics is used in science, engineering, and technology.



## Core Educational Elements of Master’s Degrees

There are many types of master’s programs (NRC, 2008), just as there are many reasons that students pursue the master’s degree. Generally, STEM master’s degree programs take one of three forms. The more traditional-style STEM master’s degree program focuses on building subject matter expertise and includes a research project leading to a thesis or another type of capstone project. Within this type of degree program, there are professions such as engineering and psychology that recognize the master’s as a terminal degree, while in others, such as biology and physics, students enroll less frequently with the intent of seeking only a master’s degree. Some students may enroll in a Ph.D. program and, during the course of their studies, decide the Ph.D. degree does not fit their career plans, because they do not get the mentoring or other forms of support they need to succeed at that level, or because the master’s degree allows them to secure well-paying jobs without having to complete a Ph.D. (CGS, 2010). For others, the decision may not be mutual because institutions have the authority to ask Ph.D. students who do not perform adequately to leave the program early; if they have completed enough requirements of the program, they may receive a master’s degree.



## Common Elements Among Master’s Degree Programs:

1. **Disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge:** 

   Master’s students should develop core disciplinary knowledge and the ability to work between disciplines.

2. **Professional competencies:** 

   Master’s students should develop abilities defined by a given profession (e.g., licensing, other credentials).

3. **Foundational and transferrable skills:** 

   Master’s students should develop skills that transcend disciplines and are applicable in any context, such as communications, leadership, and working in teams. These dimensions are especially critical as the lines that traditionally define scientific and engineering disciplines become blurred—and more scientific research and application are characterized by the convergence of disciplines.

4. **Research:** 

   Master’s students should develop the ability to apply the scientific method, understand the application of statistical analysis, gain experience in conducting research and other field studies, learn about and understand the importance of research responsibility and integrity, and engage in work-based learning and research in a systematic manner.
