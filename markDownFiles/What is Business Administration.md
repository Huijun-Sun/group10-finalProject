An MBA, or ‘Master of Business Administration’, is an elite qualification for **business professionals**. MBA courses focus on developing the leadership, initiative and individual excellence required for high-flying careers in management and entrepreneurship.

Originating in America during the 20th century, the MBA is actually a relatively new postgraduate qualification. MBA programs have rapidly established themselves as the mark of serious business professionals around the world.

## Who should study an MBA?
