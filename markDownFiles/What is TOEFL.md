Taking the TOEFL test is a very important part of your journey to studying in an English-speaking country or program. Here's a basic overview to help you learn more about the test.



## The basics of the TOEFL test:

The TOEFL test measures your ability to use and understand the English language as it's read, written, heard and spoken in the university classroom. As the most accepted English-language test in the world, more than 8,500 universities, agencies, and other institutions in more than 130 countries accept the TOEFL test as part of their admissions criteria, including nearly every college and university in Australia and the UK.

The test, often referred to as the TOEFL iBT test, is administered at more than 4,500 test sites around the world. A paper-based version of the test is available in areas where TOEFL iBT testing is not possible.

In order for the TOEFL iBT to measure how well you read, listen, speak and write in English, and how well you use these skills together, you'll be asked to integrate these skills for the test. For example, you may read a passage or listen to a lecture, and then write or speak about what you learned.

The computer-based TOEFL test has four sections.
